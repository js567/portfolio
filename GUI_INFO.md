# gui-sample-info
An example of a GUI I made for a research group at Oregon State that I am working with. This interface was used to help perform tests of robotic grasping systems.

Some of the functionality has not been included so that it will run well on any computer. The camera control buttons and file write buttons will not have any functionality when this file is running. 

This requires tkinter installed (pip install python-tk).

Thanks for taking a look! Let me know if you have any questions or comments.
