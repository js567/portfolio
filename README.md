# portfolio

Here are some projects that I have been working on recently. 

Python is a relatively new skill for me, so this portfolio does not yet have many projects, but I plan to keep adding examples as I learn more and complete more work.

Thanks for taking a look! Let me know if you have any questions or comments at jstevenson567@gmail.com
